    top down
    portal leads to rouge-lite hades 2 combat - spits out resources as the fighter dives into portal and fights enemies
    builder produces upgrades/consumables for the fighter, fighter produces resources for the builder

    maybe enemies attack the base sometimes?
    - Fighter might have to return
    - Gives the builder a second objective

    Let the Builder influence portal events (e.g., deploying drones or calling the Fighter back for specific emergencies).

## Game Loop

### Preparation Phase
    Builder Tasks:
        Set up production chains, refine raw materials, and construct structures.
        Craft weapons, armor, and consumables for the Fighter.

    Fighter Tasks:
        Equip and customize gear crafted by the Builder.
        Prepare for portal dives with consumables like health potions or energy boosts.

### Portal Dive Phase
    Rogue-Lite Combat:
        Fighter enters a portal to procedurally generated dungeons.
        Encounters waves of enemies, traps, and mini-bosses in Hades 2-style action combat.
        Resources collected are sent back to the Builder either during the run (via relay points) or upon returning.

    Risk-Reward Mechanic:
        Deeper dives yield higher rewards but increase the risk of dying and losing some resources.
        Fighter may need to return prematurely if the base is under attack or if they need emergency repairs/upgrades.

### Base Defense Phase
    Enemies periodically attack the Builder’s base during portal dives.
    If the base is overwhelmed, Fighter can exit the portal to help defend.

    Dynamic Priority Shifts:
        Builder focuses on repairing defenses, deploying traps, or optimizing automation.
        Fighter juggles defending the base and progressing through the portal.


## Fighter-Builder Interplay

    Fighter to Builder:
        Supplies raw materials from dungeon dives.
        Defends the Builder during base attacks.

    Builder to Fighter:
        Crafts and delivers upgrades, consumables, and advanced weapons.
        Improves base defenses to reduce the Fighter’s need to return during attacks.


## Dynamic Events

    Portal Anomalies:
        Occasionally, portals spawn rare dungeons with higher rewards but tougher challenges.
        Cursed portals offer huge resource hauls but spawn waves of enemies targeting the base.

    Base Emergency Events:
        Weather hazards or power surges disable parts of the Builder’s systems.
        Fighter must retrieve specific materials or survive a timed portal run to stabilize the base.


## Replayability

    Procedurally Generated Worlds:
        Each portal dive and base raid features randomized elements to keep gameplay fresh.

    Role Variance:
        Players can swap roles between sessions for a fresh perspective on teamwork and strategy.

    Difficulty Scaling:
        Base raids and portal dungeon challenges scale as the team progresses, ensuring consistent tension.


## Unique Selling Points

    Asymmetrical Multiplayer Roles: Fighter and Builder are distinct yet deeply interconnected.
    
    Rogue-Lite Combat Meets Automation: Combines the adrenaline of combat with the satisfaction of production optimization.

    Dynamic Collaboration: Base raids and portal dives force constant cooperation and adaptation.

    Replayability and Depth: Procedural generation and evolving challenges ensure long-term engagement.
